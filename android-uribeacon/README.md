# Android UriBeacon Library and Samples

Welcome to library and code samples for Android developers. Here you
can browse sample code and learn how to build UriBeacon components for
your applications.

## Using Android Studio

1. Unpack the downloaded project package.

2. In [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html),
chose `File > Import Project` and select the root folder of the

Android Studio may ask you to choose the type of project you are
