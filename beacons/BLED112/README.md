**BlueGiga BGScript Reference Implementation**

This URIBeacon implementation uses BGScript from BlueGiga to implement the full URIBeacon API. It currently supports configuration mode for 30 seconds only when the unit is powered up. (assuming there is no hardware button on the device)

Even if you are not planning on using BGScript, it is still useful as a sample app to guide your implementation.
